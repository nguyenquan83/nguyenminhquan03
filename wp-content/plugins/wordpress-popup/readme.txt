### Instant Templates For Every Kind Of Offer

Hustle makes the process of creating popups, slide-ins, and embeds easier with a range of pre-designed templates. The templates available represent a number of different use cases (e.g. Black Friday, giveaway, COVID notice, newsletter signup), meaning you can get started with a module that aligns with your campaign goals.

### Get Creative With Styling For Desktop and Mobile
Hustle’s flexible appearance settings can help your marketing stand out. Choose colors, animations, layouts, drop shadows, and display conditions from the easy-to-use design settings for all your marketing modules. By default layouts and templates are fully mobile responsive. But you can also make granular adjustments (margins, padding, borders, container sizing) to ensure your modules are popping on all devices.

### Take Styling & Customization Even Further
If you have an eye for detail you’ll love the additional customization options available with Hustle. As well as basic appearance elements like layout, images, typography, and color - Hustle allows for more advanced detailing like borders, spacing, shadow, module sizing, and more. There’s also custom CSS if you’d really like to make your modules your own.

### Highly Targeted Display Settings
Hustle has all the behavior and condition settings you’ll need to target visitors with email opt-ins or ads. Set up intelligent conditions such as: specific pages and posts, visitor device/browser, country, source of arrival, post registration, browser cookie, and a whole lot more.

### Smart Triggers For Popups And Slide-ins
As well as intelligent visibility conditions, Hustle also allows you to set up a range of behavior triggers for your popups and slide-ins. Including: time on page, scroll, exit-intent, and more.

### Set Specific Schedules For Best Results
Hustle makes it easy to schedule exactly when you want your marketing modules to deploy. Set start and end dates, schedule modules to show on specific days of the week, at a certain time of day, and choose a custom timezone to adhere to.

### Reach Out To Visitors Via Email
Once a user has engaged with one of your marketing modules it’s important to follow up with next steps or a simple welcome message. Hustle’s email settings allow you to easily whip up manual or automated email messages and establish that initial connection.

### Get Busy With Social Sharing
Hustle includes top social icons for easily building your following on your favorite social networks. Quickly enable the most popular social networks and use floating social, widgets, and shortcodes to add followers.

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Pinterest
- Reddit
- LinkedIn

- 500px
- Houzz
- Instagram
- Twitch
- YouTube

### Form Builder Integrations
Hustle integrates with popular free form builders like [Forminator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/forminator/), so you can embed your forms, polls, and quizzes into popups and slide-ins for interactive lead generation. Grow your following and capture more leads with Hustle.

### Gutenberg WordPress Editor Block

### Smart Exit-Intent
Hustle has exit-intent, a favorite of professional marketers, that detects when visitors are about to leave your site and – BOOM! A pop-up or slide-in to grab their attention.

### ReCAPTCHA Spam Warrior
Keep bot subscribers from taking over your mailing lists. Hustle connects to Googles ReCAPTCHA to protect your signup forms from spam.

### Adblock is no Match for Hustle
Hustle has the moves and displays pop-ups and slide-ins even when Adblockers try to block your content.

### Measure Performance and Results
Whether you’ve created a popup, slide in, or embed, Hustle allows you to track the results of each individual module with intelligent tracking data, conversion stats, and insightful charts for a visual representation. You can also set up a custom widget and include stats on your WP dashboard.
